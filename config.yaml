#    🧪 SIMULATOR PARAMETERS 🧪   #
#                                 #
#=================================#
# If interested in using, have to rework for the current sheet #

simulator:
  capital: 10000
  commission: 1
  simultaneous_positions: # variants to go through, could be multiple to consider
#    - 1
    - 2

  # Parameters for sampling
  # This is used when running --sampling for simulaton using different start dates and sample exclusions
  sample_size: 10  # Number of sample dates to use
  random_exclusion_rate: 0.15  # Percentage of rows to randomly exclude (as decimal)

  # Settings for partial entries (always on as position management is important)
  # The first entry will be partial and then will need to wait for higher close
  first_entry_allocation: 0.5  # percentage of initial entry (0.5 is 50%)

  close_higher_percentage_variants: # close above bullish reference candle is needed for the second entry
#    - 0       # 0%
    - 0.0055  # 0.55%
#    - 0.01    # 1%
  # ^^^ to test variants later

  ### Stop-related behaviour
  stop_below_bullish_reference_variants: # this is for the level below the bullish candle's low 
#    - 0
#    - 0.01
    - 0.025

  stop_loss_management:  # take profit if the price increases to an amount X and then falls back
    price_increase_trigger: 0.08  # % increase from average entry price (e.g. 0.07 is 7%)
    new_stop_loss_level: 0.04     # X% above average entry price. the result was better with the value of 3%, need testing

  breakeven_stop_loss:  # to check if we want to use breakeven stop loss
    enabled: false
    price_increase_trigger: 0.05  # X% profit to trigger breakeven stop loss

  ### Filters to use
  # Note: This is only applied when run in the RND mode

  ### Fisher distance related take profit

  ### Take profit variants

#      - level: 10%
#        move_stop_price: False

# Output will contain -> TRAILING PROFIT HIT for trailing profit and -> STOP LOSS HIT for stop losses
